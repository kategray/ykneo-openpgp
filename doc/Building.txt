Building
--------

There are several ways to build the project:

1) With ant, using JCKit.

2) With Eclipse and eclipse-jcde, using JCKit.

3) Using proprietary NXP Java Card tools.

We usually suggest using Ant.

Installing JCKit
----------------
In order to build with modern JDK versions, it is necessary to install a modern JDK.  To target older cards, a target SDK
of 2.2.2 is also required.

Install the Java Card Classic Development Kit, version 3.0.5u3, downloaded from:
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javame-419430.html#java_card_kit-classic-3_0_5-ga-win32-bin-do

This installer is windows-only.  Copy the files (typically installed to C:\Program Files (x86)\Oracle\Java Card Development Kit 3.0.5u3),
to the folder jckit/sdk-3.0.5

Install the Java Card Development Kit version 2.2.2, download it from:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javame-419430.html#java_card_kit-2.2.2-oth-JPR

Extract the contents of java_card_kit-2_2_2-rr-bin-*-do.zip to jckit/sdk-2.2.2

Installing JCardSim
-------------------

This is needed for 'ant test' to work.

curl -L https://github.com/licel/jcardsim/raw/jc2.2.2/jcardsim-2.2.2-all.jar -o test/lib/jcardsim-2.2.2-all.jar

The SHA256 checksum on the file we have successfully used is:
33c167e9bf989c3fca692f8053b8032280a1cbca79df818e131c486dd174746a

Ant
---

The project can now be built by invoking ant.

The cap file for loading on card will be at:

 ./applet/bin/openpgpcard.cap

Eclipe and eclipse-jcde
-----------------------

First install Eclipse following instructions on: http://www.eclipse.org/

On Debian/Ubuntu systems Eclipse is packaged and can be installed from
the command line:

  apt-get install eclipse

Start Eclipse once to make sure it creates a $HOME/.eclipse/
directory.  Then quit Eclipse.

Download the eclipse-jcde-0.2.zip file from:
http://eclipse-jcde.sourceforge.net/

and unpack it like this:

  $ cd ~/.eclipse/*/
  $ unzip /path/to/eclipse-jcde-0.2.zip

The path to unpack the file into depends on your Eclipse installation,
on my Debien Wheezy system the directory was called
~/.eclipse/org.eclipse.platform_3.8_155965261/

Start Eclipse again and confirm that you have a new top-level menu
called "Java Card".  Then in Eclipse select the "Preferences" menu
under "Java Card" and point the "Java Card Home" directory to
/path/to/jckit/java_card_kit-2_2_2 replacing /path/to as appropriate.

After that the project can be imported into the workspace.
Right-click in the "Project Explorer" window and select "Import".
Under "General" select "Existing Projects into Workspace".  As the
root directory point the directory holding this file.  You need to
select "Copy projects into workspace".

To build the .cap file, expand and right click on the "openpgpcard"
sub-directory and select "Java Card Tools" and then "Convert".  The
CAP file will be available in your Eclipse workspace as:

  ./applet/bin/openpgpcard/javacard/openpgpcard.cap

Tests
-----

To run the tests jcardsim is required. The jar can be fetched from
https://github.com/licel/jcardsim/raw/jc2.2.2/jcardsim-2.2.2-all.jar
and should be put into the test/lib directory.
